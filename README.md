We wish to calculate the Newton polygon of an Artin-Schreier-Witt curve. The code in this repository allows us to do that.

Thanks to Kiran Kedlaya for explaining the process of implementing this without having to do the explicit point counts and then input those by hand.

I also wish to note that there is occasionally a discrepency between the Newton Polygon reported by SageMath and by Magma. The polygon output by SageMath is the correct output. 


Unfortunately, this requires spaghetti code to pull off. The file newton3.sage corresponds to newton3.m.
